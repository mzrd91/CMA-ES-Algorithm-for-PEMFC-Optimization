# CMA-ES-Algorithm-for-PEMFC-Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm to optimize the seven parameters for the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) problem as described in the [Chakraborty et al. paper in Energy(2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544212000448).
